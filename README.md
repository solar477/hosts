<h3><em>Warning</em>: This is not your standard blocking-list!</h3>


```diff
-! That HOSTS-file is huge! (~50MB)
# Android-apps (AdGuard, Blokada) will only partially load it.
# Try using it as an OS HOSTS-file (Android - root!, Windows - pre-disable 'DNS Client' service!).

-! Blocks: 
-! Some social-networks (Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, Pintrest, ...). 
-! Some 3'rd-party comment-services (Disqus, Spot.im, ...). 
-! An extended (!) list of stuff other lists blocks as well (ads, analytics, fishing, malwares).
-! Annoying stuff or websites. Just my personal opinion.

# If you are using this list and find-out your favorite website is blocked - open an issue.

+~ Google (except for the ads-domains) and WhatsApp (although it's Facebook's) are cool . 

# Using those lists will greatly privacy and speed-up browsing on any operation-system.
# I suggest you also set-up 'AdGuard-DNS' as your DNS. Works best in your home-router!
```

<h3>Note: I no longer distribute HOSTS with the 127.0.0.1 prefix. Use 'hosts0.txt' or 'hosts0_with_localhost.txt' links instead.</h3>

You can either use <code>eladkarako</code> as the <code>USERNAME</code> (links/folder-structure might be change some day), 
or <strong>fork the repository and use your own github-username</strong>.

<h3>What are all of those links?</h3>

The <code>_raw__hosts.txt</code> file is just a raw list of the host-domains (without any prefix),
<del><code>hosts.txt</code> uses <code>127.0.0.1 </code> prefix for each line</del>,
<code>hosts0.txt</code> uses <code>0.0.0.0 </code> prefix for each line,

<del><code>hosts_with_localhost.txt</code></del> and <code>hosts0_with_localhost.txt</code> uses the same prefixes but adds an additional entries for machine's self-<code>localhost</code>.

The <code>hosts_adblock.txt</code> has the same content as <code>_raw__hosts.txt</code> built with an additional <a href="https://github.com/gorhill/uBlock/wiki/Static-filter-syntax/">uBlock-filter format</a> file-headers.

You may download the whole repository in a zip file (about 200MB though!):
<a href="https://github.com/USERNAME/hosts/archive/master.zip">https://github.com/USERNAME/hosts/archive/master.zip</a>. 
Aria2C or similar parallel-download-manager is advised!

<h3>Custom lists:</h3>
Once you've fetched the repository (by either simply download it or by fork-and-clone), 
you may edit it and generate new build. 

It is very easy to generate a new "build", 

There are <strong>no dependencies</strong>!

Only thing needed is <strong>any version of NodeJS</strong> on your machine.

For example, you can get a single exe for Windows in <a href="https://nodejs.org/download/nightly">https://nodejs.org/download/nightly</a>. Just choose a version and browse <code>win-x86/</code> folder, downloading <code>node.exe</code>.

To generate a new "build", delete the build folder, 
and run your NodeJS with <code>_builder.js</code>. You may use <code>_builder.cmd</code> on Windows.

I'm not being pa!d for it or anything, 
but if you want to protect yourself from ads and other malicious domains, 
I strongly advise you'll change your home (or work) router's DNS to AdGuard's DNS. 
It is free, and it will block ads in a similar way to the way the HOSTS file works, 
by returning <code>0.0.0.0</code> to several (although not as much as mine) domains, 
instead of actual-resolving into IP. You can still use HOSTS and AdBlocking-browser-extensions, 
this is just another way you can help all the clients (smartphones, smart-TVs, computers,...) 
of your home WiFi, without the needs to root Android devices, or install anything. 
The DNS addresses you should change into are: <strong><code>176.103.130.130</code></strong> and <strong><code>176.103.130.131</code></strong>. Google AdGuard-DNS for more information.
